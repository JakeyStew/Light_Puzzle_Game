# :jigsaw: Light Puzzle Game :joystick:

[Light Puzzler] is a simple to use puzzle game. Simple try to turn all the tiles on adn you win, nothing complicated about that, or is there?

This App was built within a day for a technical challenge. It taught me more about the C# language and .Net framework alongside some simple XAML for the front end user interface.

## Tech Stack

- C#
- .NET 4.7.2
- XAML

## Running

This app is very simple to run, just download the source code and built it in VSCode or Visual Studio 2019+. You can also run the .exe in the Release folder.
